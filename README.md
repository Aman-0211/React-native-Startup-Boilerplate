React-Native Template
CircleCI branch

A template of how I think a React-Native project should be laid out.

Contains:
Navigation: react-native.Navigator
Running the project
Requires react-native-cli installed

Clone the project
Install dependencies with npm install
Linking dependencies react-native link && if having react-natve version > 0.60 also need to run npx pod-install ios
Start the dev server with npm start
Run with react-native run
